    <h1>First Steps</h1>

    <p>As you may or may not already know, HTML files are the backbone of the user-facing world wide web.
        HTML is an extension of XML, which basically means that there are "nodes" or "elements" (i.e. each tag),
        and those elements each can have their own "child" elements nested within them. In addition to children,
        elements can have "attributes", which are additional data associated with the element.
    </p>
    <p>
        A webpage consists of an HTML file, which encodes <em>what</em> the information displayed is. However in most cases HTML files are
        not standalone - they are often embedded with CSS and JavaScript.

        We will cover these two in later sessions, but put simply CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is for the visual aspect of the page, and gives
        instructions on how things should <em>look</em>. JavaScript gives the page interactivity, and gives instructions on what the browser
        should <em>do</em>. For example, if I want a webpage to change the background colour when I click on a button, this is only possible
        through a combination of CSS and JavaScript, it's not possible with HTML alone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each HTML element type has <em>semantics</em>, which indicate to the browser (and often the user through styling) what the meaning
        of the information within the tags are.

        Learning all the HTML elements takes time, and it's probably not worth rote learning for now. I think the best approach is to learn
        them organically as you require them in your own projects.
