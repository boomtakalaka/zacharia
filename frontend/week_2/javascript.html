  <h1>JavaScript</h1>
  <p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed, functional, objected oriented and imperative programming language. It was born out of making pages
    interactive in the early days of the internet. Prior to JavaScript, pages only had rudimentary interactivity such as clicking on links 
    redirecting the user. With modern JavaScript and browser APIs such as Canvas, WebGL and Web Audio, complex applications can be made
    for the browser.
  </p>
  <h3>Browser application examples:</h3>

  <h2>JavaScript as a programming language</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript is a C-like language, which is a family of languages based off C. Examples include C++, Java and C#. The syntax for JavaScript is largely
    the same as the aforementioned languages, with curly braces for defining scope, dots for accessing object members and semicolon line endings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike its relative though, it is a dynamically typed language, which is often JIT compiled (not compiled upfront). This means you do not type any variables,
    so the programmer must understand what the intended type for a variable is by looking at the code. Variables can be assigned to any type at any point.
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript also has automatic lifetime control for objects in memory. In C/C++, every single piece of memory that is allocated on the heap must be managed manually - 
    using malloc/free or new/delete. In JavaScript this is not necessary, nor possible. You don't have to worry too much about what this means, the only implication is 
    that you can't delete things out of memory as the programmer. The browser will do this for you at some point.
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript's object model is also different to its C-like cousins. JavaScript uses prototypes to implement OO, which is quite different to most programming languages.
    Most programming languages use class based object orientation. The fact that JavaScript is dynamically typed, and that it uses prototypical inheritance means that
    there are quirks to using OO in JavaScript compared to other languages. We can get into this later down the line.
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript has functional programming language features. The first and foremost feature is the fact that functions are first class objects. This means that functions
    can be assigned to variables like any other object, and also manipulated as objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    An important concept in functional programming is the use of callbacks. This is simply a function that is passed to another function to be used at a later point. This
    can be chained as deeply as the programmer wishes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Functions are defined using the `function` keyword, or arrow functions. `function` functions can either be named or anonymous. Regular functions and arrow functions differ
    mainly in how the `this` keyword is bound - arrow functions bind `this` lexically (looks at the surrounding scope) and `function` uses the calling context as `this`, which
    basically means that for regular functions `this` can mean different things depending on where it is called, whereas arrow functions always have the same meaning for `this`
  </p>
  <h2>How JavaScript is included in a web page</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is included in a HTML page in three ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Directly written inside a script tag</li>
    <li>A script tag with a `src` attribute pointing to a remote JS tag (most common)</li>
    <li>Written in an attribute of an HTML element (e.g. on an `onclick` attribute)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Web API ('Web Page' JavaScript)</h2>
  <p>There is a specific set of interfaces just for the browser. We've used `console`, `document` and `window` so far. They will be the most used interfaces for interfacing
    with the web page or the browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like any API, you will learn this organically through searching the internet and from reading web code. 99% of the time you will be using the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document">document</a> (interface to the DOM)</li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a> (interface to the browser window)</li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console">console</a> (interface for debugger)</li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event">Event API</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Promise">Promise API</a> (Asynchronous programming API)</li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch API</a> (For asynchronous fetching of remote files)</li>
  </ul>
