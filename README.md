# Hello world!

It's time to become a _real_ developer. Whatever that means. This is a starting point for you and I hope the stuff you learn here will keep you going for years to come.

## Structure

I'm going to start this off with just this repository only, as we'll only be dealing with HTML files + documentation that goes along with them. As soon as we start progressing into more advanced topics and applications, we'll be using different repositories for each example or application (it's easier to manage that way).

## Misc

You are welcome to commit anything you like to this repository. If there's specific questions or things you want to get into you can create an issue on GitHub, message me, or even commit some code that you want to do some work on.
