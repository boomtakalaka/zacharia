# Assignment

This is your first assignment. The task is to create a _pure_ HTML page which resembles [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

## Requirements

Since this is a pure HTML file, there will be no styling and interactivity involved (unless you are super eager).

The bare basics you must cover are:

- Page title
- Page heading
- The introduction section
- Any additional sections you feel like implementing
- A table
- At least one functional link

### Useful stuff

### Extras

If you are feeling brave, try to style the page to be close to the Wikipedia styling using CSS.

Hint: Put your styling code in a <style> tag in the <head> of your page. You can also use a browser to reverse engineer Wikipedia's styling.
